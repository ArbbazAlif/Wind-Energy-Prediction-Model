# Loan Default Prediction System 🏦💡

This repository contains the implementation of a **Loan Default Prediction System**, developed as a machine learning project to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on historical data. This system is useful for banks and financial institutions to assess credit risk and make informed lending decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Loan Default Prediction System is built using a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning models to predict loan defaults. It includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing data and outliers
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model building and evaluation
- Confusion matrix, classification reports, and ROC AUC score
